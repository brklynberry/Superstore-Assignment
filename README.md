# Part 1: Excel Spreadsheet Manipulation
For the first part of the assignment, I added the requested columns('Regional_Manager','Target_Profit_Manager','Profit_Margin','Above_Target','Days_to_Ship','Ship_Performance') and filled the respective cells with the provided formulas. The results are saved in 'Superstore_Enriched.xlsx'.

# Part 2: Data Pipeline via Streamlit Community Cloud
For the second part of the assignment, I created a dashboard visualization using 'Superstore_Enriched.xlsx' from the first part. I cleaned and processed the code using various modules for efficiency. After the data was prepared and compatible with Streamlit, I created various visualizations to enhance data comprehension. Features include a user friendly year range selection tool, charts and graphs to visualize trends and proportions, as well as region/state/city drop down to access data with respect to particular areas. Upon completion of the dashboard, it was then deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud.
